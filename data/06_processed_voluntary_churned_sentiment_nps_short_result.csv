713390433,I have had an argos card for years and have never had a problem always used buy now pay later and always paid on time because I'm very organised. However yesterday I had an email off then saying they had started a credit plan and my first payment was coming out on 25th and it was for a very shocking ammount of money. I originally thought it was fraud so I phoned up argos to then find it was a purchase I made last year that I hadn't paid off. Having looked back through my bank statements it looks like this wasn't paid however I had paid other stuff off on there more recently and cleared the card so I would have noticed the outstanding payment and paid it off. I think argos didn't show that I had this left to pay until my year was up then automatically charged me. I have no proof of any of this though because they send no emails all I have is an email of me ordering it and then my bank statement to show I never paid it but I have no proof of them not showing the outstanding payment in the app so I haven't been able to take this further. I have unfortunately had to pay the ammount and once it's all gone through I will be cancelling my argos card and never using again. It is a shame because I did enjoy using it but I believe they have conned me out of money.,NEGATIVE,0.9980560541152954,-0.9980560541152954,Detractor,93.66812227074236,0

718297683,I have had an argos card for years and have never had a problem always used buy now pay later and always paid on time because I'm very organised. However yesterday I had an email off then saying they had started a credit plan and my first payment was coming out on 25th and it was for a very shocking ammount of money. I originally thought it was fraud so I phoned up argos to then find it was a purchase I made last year that I hadn't paid off. Having looked back through my bank statements it looks like this wasn't paid however I had paid other stuff off on there more recently and cleared the card so I would have noticed the outstanding payment and paid it off. I think argos didn't show that I had this left to pay until my year was up then automatically charged me. I have no proof of any of this though because they send no emails all I have is an email of me ordering it and then my bank statement to show I never paid it but I have no proof of them not showing the outstanding payment in the app so I haven't been able to take this further. I have unfortunately had to pay the ammount and once it's all gone through I will be cancelling my argos card and never using again. It is a shame because I did enjoy using it but I believe they have conned me out of money.,NEGATIVE,0.9980560541152954,-0.9980560541152954,Detractor,93.66812227074236,0

789713208,I have had an argos card for years and have never had a problem always used buy now pay later and always paid on time because I'm very organised. However yesterday I had an email off then saying they had started a credit plan and my first payment was coming out on 25th and it was for a very shocking ammount of money. I originally thought it was fraud so I phoned up argos to then find it was a purchase I made last year that I hadn't paid off. Having looked back through my bank statements it looks like this wasn't paid however I had paid other stuff off on there more recently and cleared the card so I would have noticed the outstanding payment and paid it off. I think argos didn't show that I had this left to pay until my year was up then automatically charged me. I have no proof of any of this though because they send no emails all I have is an email of me ordering it and then my bank statement to show I never paid it but I have no proof of them not showing the outstanding payment in the app so I haven't been able to take this further. I have unfortunately had to pay the ammount and once it's all gone through I will be cancelling my argos card and never using again.

787452333,I have had an argos card for years and have never had a problem always used buy now pay later and always paid on time because I'm very organised. However yesterday I had an email off then saying they had started a credit plan and my first payment was coming out on 25th and it was for a very shocking ammount of money. I originally thought it was fraud so I phoned up argos to then find it was a purchase I made last year that I hadn't paid off. Having looked back through my bank statements it looks like this wasn't paid however I had paid other stuff off on there more recently and cleared the card so I would have noticed the outstanding payment and paid it off. I think argos didn't show that I had this left to pay until my year was up then automatically charged me. I have no proof of any of this though because they send no emails all I have is an email of me ordering it and then my bank statement to show I never paid it but I have no proof of them not showing the outstanding payment in the app so I haven't been able to take this further. I have unfortunately had to pay the ammount and once it's all gone through I will be cancelling my argos card and never using again. It is a shame because I did enjoy using it but I believe they have conned me out of money.,NEGATIVE,0.9980560541152954,-0.9980560541152954,Detractor,93.66812227074236,0

779084208,"The problem with the Argos card is that it seems to have been set up to trap people in debt. Other 'shops' in the same sector (AO, Very, Currys) offer between 12 months and 36 months for large purchases. Argos offer 6 months. On laptops costing between £1500 and £3000 this is ridiculous for the majority of people. The aim seems to get people off BNPL onto (very) high interest_bearing 'normal' credit. Since Sainsburys have taken over the situation is worsening. Even the maximum 12 months interest free periods are few and far between. It's a cut throat explotative way to run a business.... and certainly not one that is putting customers first. Argos.... your people are lovely. Your buyers have a good grasp of the market. Your pricing is competitive (even if you do not price match). But.... this transparent way of pushing people into debt with restrictive credit terms on large purchases is plainly wrong, if not immoral. It's a shame ... and does little for your reputation.
