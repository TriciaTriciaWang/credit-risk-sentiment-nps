713390433,I have had an argos card for years and have never had a problem always used buy now pay later and always paid on time because I'm very organised. However yesterday I had an email off then saying they had started a credit plan and my first payment was coming out on 25th and it was for a very shocking ammount of money. I originally thought it was fraud so I phoned up argos to then find it was a purchase I made last year that I hadn't paid off. Having looked back through my bank statements it looks like this wasn't paid however I had paid other stuff off on there more recently and cleared the card so I would have noticed the outstanding payment and paid it off. I think argos didn't show that I had this left to pay until my year was up then automatically charged me. I have no proof of any of this though because they send no emails all I have is an email of me ordering it and then my bank statement to show I never paid it but I have no proof of them not showing the outstanding payment in the app so I haven't been able to take this further. I have unfortunately had to pay the ammount and once it's all gone through I will be cancelling my argos card and never using again.

I originally thought it was fraud so I phoned up argos to then find it was a purchase I made last year that I hadn't paid off. Having looked back through my bank statements it looks like this wasn't paid however I had paid other stuff off on there more recently and cleared the card so I would have noticed the outstanding payment and paid it off. I think argos didn't show that I had this left to pay until my year was up then automatically charged me. I have no proof of any of this though because they send no emails all I have is an email of me ordering it and then my bank statement to show I never paid it but I have no proof of them not showing the outstanding payment in the app so I haven't been able to take this further.
